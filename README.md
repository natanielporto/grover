# Grover Front-end project

This was created with:

```
- React
- TypeScript
- React router
- Styled Components
- ESLint - AirBnB style guide
- Prettier
- Yarn
- Jest (unit testing)
```
In order to recreate the project, clone it and run "npm i" or "yarn" in the root of the project.

If you don't have Yarn installed, just click the following link to download and install the latest version: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install

- *Important*: remove the .example from the .env in order for the queries to work properly or substitute the environment variable with one of your own.

After that, to start the project just run ```yarn start``` or the equivalent for npm.

## Objective of the project
This is an app to fetch the New York Times articles and present them to the reader.
 - the project will auto-populate with a list of articles with no particular interest, as the API suggests;
 - type the keyword(s) of your liking in the search bar and it will automatically fetch it from the API, no need to press enter or clicking anything;
 - to refresh the search, simply delete your entry and search for another keyword'
 - in order to further investigate the articles presented to you, click on the one that caught your attention. You will be redirected to a page containing pertinent informations about it, like: title, date of publication and the NYT url to read it on their website;

### Heads up
1 - I tried to do it as close as I could with the screen provided; <br>
2 - I was about to create my own approach (the next and previous buttons show that). I mailed the person that invited me but I had no replies, so I stuck to the original proposal; <br>
3 - I did as many tests as I could. Sorry if it's not 100% but I have lots of things on my plate since it's the end of the year and end of sprints, projects, classes, college, etc. <br>
Nevertheless, I believe that they show what I know and what I'm capable of doing; <br>
4 - It could use some refactoring in order not to repeat the code - mock information in tests, for instance - but then I would not be able to finish and present to you in time because of the same reasons previously explained.  <br>

If you want me to re-do it with a different layout perspective, just let me know. I really want to be a part of the team.
